# Introduction
This project analyzes sales data from a Brazilian e-commerce company using SQL. The dataset, provided by Olist, Instead of including all nine files, I narrowed it down to four: `customers`, `orders`, `order_items`, and `products`. This keeps the scope manageable but still allows for more in-depth analysis, with over 100,000 records. The goal was to clean, analyze, and derive insights from the data to understand customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.

I created a MySQL database ecommerce_analysis and imported the selected datasets using MySQL Workbench's Import Wizard. After verifying the data was imported correctly, I connected MySQL Workbench with Visual Studio Code using SQLTools and SQLTools MySQL/MariaDB/TiDB extensions. This allows me to query the database directly from VS Code.

# Background
The dataset consists of four main tables:
- **Customers**: Contains customer information, including unique IDs, zip codes, cities, and states.
- **Orders**: Includes order details such as order status, purchase timestamp, and delivery dates.
- **Products**: Provides product details like category, weight, dimensions, and description length.
- **Order_Items**: Links orders to products and includes details like price and quantity.

The dataset contained approximately 120,000 records across the four tables, with some missing values and inconsistencies that required cleaning. This analysis aims to help the company understand customer behavior, identify popular products, and optimize sales strategies.

# Tools I Used
- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database.
- **MySQL Workbench**: For database management system.
- **Visual Studio Code**: For writing, data cleaning, querying, analysis and organizing SQL scripts and documentation.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.


# The Analysis

## **Data Cleaning**
The dataset required cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. Here are the steps I took:

SQL queries? Check them out here: [Data_Cleaning_sql folder](/project_sql/Data_Cleaning_sql/)

1. **Handling Missing Values**: No missing values were found in critical columns, so no replacements were needed.  
2. **Removing Duplicates**: No duplicate records were found, so no removals were necessary.
3. **Standardizing Data**: Date columns were converted to a consistent format, and text columns were standardized.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
The exploratory analysis revealed several insights:

## 1. **Customer Distribution** 
SQL queries? Check them out here: [1_Customer_distribution file](/project_sql/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_(EDA)/1_Customer_distribution)

**Customer distribution by state**

Most customers are concentrated in `S達o Paulo` (SP) and `Rio de Janeiro` (RJ), the latter with the greatest number by far. The distribution shows that these states are key markets, likely due to higher population density and economic activity.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
    SELECT customer_state, 
    COUNT(*) AS customer_count
    FROM Customers
    GROUP BY customer_state
    ORDER BY customer_count DESC;
```
| Customer State | Customer Count |
|---------------|---------------|
| SP            | 41746         |
| RJ            | 12852         |
| MG            | 11635         |
| RS            | 5466          |
| PR            | 5045          |

**Top 10 cities with the most customers**

S達o Paulo has the largest number of customers (15,540), more than twice that of Rio de Janeiro (6,882). The pattern shows a high concentration of customers in large cities, with a sharp drop-off after the first two.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
    SELECT customer_city, 
    COUNT(*) AS customer_count
    FROM Customers
    GROUP BY customer_city
    ORDER BY customer_count DESC
    LIMIT 10;
```
| Customer City          | Customer Count |
|------------------------|---------------|
| sao paulo             | 15540         |
| rio de janeiro        | 6882          |
| belo horizonte        | 2773          |
| brasilia              | 2131          |

### 2. **Order Patterns**
SQL queries? Check them out here: [2_Order_Patterns file](/project_sql/Exploratory_Data_Analysis(EDA)/2_Order_Patterns)

**Percentage of Delivered Orders**

97% of orders were successfully delivered, and only a negligible portion (1.1%) are in transit. Unavailable items and cancellations collectively represent approximately 1.2% of all orders. All other statuses, such as invoiced and processing, have a very small effect on total order flow.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
    SELECT 
        order_status, 
        COUNT(*) AS order_count, 
        (COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER ()) AS status_percentage
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY order_status
    ORDER BY order_count DESC;
```

| order_status  | order_count | status_percentage |
|--------------|------------|------------------|
| delivered    | 96478      | 97.02034        |
| shipped      | 1107       | 1.11322         |
| canceled     | 625        | 0.62851         |
| unavailable  | 609        | 0.61242         |
| invoiced     | 314        | 0.31577         |
| processing   | 301        | 0.30269         |
| created      | 5          | 0.00503         |
| approved     | 2          | 0.00201         |


**Average Delivery Time by State**

Delivery times vary significantly between states, with `S達o Paulo` (SP) having the fastest average delivery (8 days, 16 hours, 49 min) and `Roraima` (RR) the slowest (29 days, 8 hours, 12 min). Variations reflect potential logistical issues in certain regions.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
    SELECT 
        c.customer_state, 
        CONCAT(
            FLOOR(AVG(DATEDIFF(o.order_delivered_customer_date, o.order_purchase_timestamp))), ' days, ', 
            FLOOR((AVG(DATEDIFF(o.order_delivered_customer_date, o.order_purchase_timestamp)) - 
                FLOOR(AVG(DATEDIFF(o.order_delivered_customer_date, o.order_purchase_timestamp)))) * 24), ' hours, ',
            ROUND((((AVG(DATEDIFF(o.order_delivered_customer_date, o.order_purchase_timestamp)) - 
                FLOOR(AVG(DATEDIFF(o.order_delivered_customer_date, o.order_purchase_timestamp)))) * 24) - 
                FLOOR((AVG(DATEDIFF(o.order_delivered_customer_date, o.order_purchase_timestamp)) - 
                FLOOR(AVG(DATEDIFF(o.order_delivered_customer_date, o.order_purchase_timestamp)))) * 24)) * 60), ' min'
        ) AS avg_delivery_time
    FROM Orders o
    JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    WHERE o.order_status = 'delivered'
    GROUP BY c.customer_state
    ORDER BY avg_delivery_time DESC;
```

| State | Average Delivery Time      |
|---------------|----------------------|
| S達o Paulo            | 8 days, 16 hours, 49 min  |
| Roraima            | 29 days, 8 hours, 12 min  |

The 10 highest-spending customers have total spending ranging from 4,590 to 13,440. There is one customer who spends far more than the rest, with over 13,000 in total spending. Targeted marketing and loyalty programs can be assisted by recognizing these high-value customers.


**SQL Query**:
```sql
    WITH CustomerSpending AS (
        SELECT
            c.customer_unique_id,
            SUM(oi.price) AS total_spent,
            CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(oi.price) DESC) AS spending_percentile
        FROM Customers c
        JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
        JOIN Order_Items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
        GROUP BY c.customer_unique_id
    )
    SELECT customer_unique_id, total_spent
    FROM CustomerSpending
    ORDER BY total_spent DESC
    LIMIT 10;
```
**Repeat Customers (More than 1 Order)**

The most loyal repeat customer has purchased 17 times, while several customers have made 4 to 9 purchases. This reflects a loyal customer base with repeat purchases. Their interests can be used to target loyalty programs and promotions.


**SQL Query**:
```sql
    SELECT 
        customer_unique_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS order_count
